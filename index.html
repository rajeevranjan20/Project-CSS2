                   <li> Python is a versatile and powerful programming language that has gained immense popularity for its simplicity, readability, and flexibility.</li>
                   <li>Python is designed to emphasize code readability with its clean and straightforward syntax, making it an excellent choice for beginners and experienced programmers alike.</li>
                   <li>Python is a high-level language, meaning that it abstracts away many of the complex details of the computer, allowing developers to focus more on solving problems and less on the intricacies of the machine.</li>
                   <li>It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming styles, giving developers the freedom to choose the approach that best fits their needs.</li>
                   <li>One of Python's key strengths is its extensive standard library, which provides a wide range of modules and packages for tasks such as working with files, handling networking, performing mathematical calculations, and much more.</li>
                   <li>Additionally, Python has a vibrant ecosystem of third-party libraries and frameworks, such as NumPy, pandas, Django, Flask, and TensorFlow, which further extend its capabilities for various domains such as data science, web development, machine learning, and more.</li>

    <section id="Installation">
        <h2>Installation</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                To install Python on your system, follow these steps:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>Download Python:</h3> Visit the official Python website at <a href="https://www.python.org/"></a> and navigate to the Downloads section. Choose the version of Python you want to install. As of my last update, Python 3 is the recommended version, so you should download the latest Python 3.x release available for your operating system.</li>
                <li><h3>Run the Installer:</h3> Once the download is complete, run the installer executable file. On Windows, this is usually a .exe file, while on macOS and Linux, it might be a .pkg or a .tar.gz file.</li>
                <li><h3>Customize Installation (Optional):</h3> During the installation process, you may have the option to customize the installation settings. You can choose the installation directory, whether to add Python to the system PATH (recommended), and whether to install additional components like pip (Python's package manager).</li>
                <li><h3>Verify Installation:</h3> After the installation is complete, you can verify that Python was installed correctly by opening a command prompt or terminal and typing python --version (or python3 --version on some systems). This should display the installed Python version.</li>
                <li><h3>Access Python Interpreter:</h3> To access the Python interpreter (the interactive shell where you can run Python code), simply type python (or python3 on some systems) in the command prompt or terminal and press Enter. You should see the Python prompt (>>>), indicating that you are now in the Python interpreter.</li>
                <li><h3>Install a Text Editor or IDE:</h3> While not strictly necessary, you may also want to install a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) to write and edit your Python code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, Atom, and IDLE (which comes bundled with Python).</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><h3>General-Purpose Languages:</h3> Both Python and C++ are general-purpose programming languages, meaning they can be used for a wide range of applications and domains.</li>
                    <li><h3>Support for Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</h3> Both languages support object-oriented programming paradigms, allowing developers to organize code into classes and objects, encapsulate data, and implement inheritance and polymorphism.
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Rich Standard Libraries:</h3> Python and C++ come with rich standard libraries that provide a wide range of functionalities for common tasks. Python's standard library is known for its extensive support for various domains, while C++'s standard library provides powerful utilities for tasks like input/output operations, data structures, and algorithms.</li>
                    <li><h3>Community Support and Ecosystem:</h3> Both languages have large and active communities, contributing to a vast ecosystem of third-party libraries, frameworks, and tools. Python's ecosystem is particularly renowned for its breadth and depth, covering areas such as web development, data science, machine learning, and more. C++ also has a strong ecosystem, with libraries and frameworks for game development, system programming, and performance-critical applications.
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Cross-Platform Compatibility:</h3> Python and C++ are both cross-platform languages, meaning they can run on multiple operating systems without modification. This makes them suitable for developing applications that need to run on different platforms.
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Memory Management:</h3> While Python handles memory management automatically (garbage collection), C++ provides more control over memory allocation and deallocation. However, both languages allow developers to work with dynamic memory allocation when needed.
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>High-Level Constructs:</h3> Despite being different in terms of syntax and performance, both Python and C++ offer high-level constructs that simplify common programming tasks. For example, both languages support control structures (e.g., loops, conditionals), data structures (e.g., lists, dictionaries, arrays), and abstraction mechanisms (e.g., functions, classes).

            Certainly! In Python, printing "Hello, World!" is a simple task. <br>Here's the classic "Hello, World!" program in Python: <br>
            <b>print("Hello, World!")</b>

    <section id="Variables">
        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <article>
            <p>
                In Python, variables are used to store data values. Unlike some other programming languages, Python is dynamically typed, which means you don't need to declare the type of a variable explicitly. Instead, Python infers the variable type based on the value assigned to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Python variable names must follow these rules:
                <ul>
                    <li>They can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, and underscores.</li>
                    <li>They cannot start with a digit.</li>
                    <li>Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are three different variables).</li>
                    <li>It's recommended to use descriptive variable names to improve code readability.</li>
                </ul>

        <article>
            <p>
                In Python, operators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on variables and values. Python supports various types of operators, including arithmetic, assignment, comparison, logical, membership, identity, and bitwise operators. Here's an overview of each type:
